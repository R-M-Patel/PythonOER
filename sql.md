# SQL

* [W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/hospital-database-exercise/sql-exercise-on-hospital-database.php) - SQL Hospital Database - Exercises, Practice, Solution
  * Large practice site with some content for a "hospital" database, not relate to actual EHR structure but a relevant practice resource.
* [Coursera - Clinical Data Models and Data Quality](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/clinical-data-models-and-data-quality-assessments/querying-omop-rOGrq) - Course focused on OMOP standard terminology
  * Have not used it first hand, the available content seems useful for both OMOP overview and ties to SQL queries
