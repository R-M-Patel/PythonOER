Why do an open resource for material?&#x20;

* Versioning - Easier to keep up with updates for links and content
* Sharing - Open source education for a "bottom-up" approach to evolving course material and ensuring wide-spread opportunity for application (see the book or wiki summary of the book:"[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](managing-data-with-excel-residents-fellows-2024.md)")
